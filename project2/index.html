        technical aspects, such as its performance and capacity, which are
        measures of a website's speed and how much traffic the site can handle.

      <h2>Type of Web Developer</h2>
      <p>
        There are three kinds of web developer specialization: front-end
        developer, back-end developer, and full-stack

          >developers</a
        >
        Front-end developers are responsible for behaviour and visuals that run
        in the user browser, back-end developers deal with the servers and
        full-stack developers are responsible for both.

        Front-end developers design the visual aspects of websites for users to
        interact with, including colors, layout, and fonts. Back-end developers
        create the invisible structure that helps websites function properly<a
